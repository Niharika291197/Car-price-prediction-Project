# Car Price Prediction Project README

## Overview
This README provides an overview of a data analysis project focused on car price prediction using Python. The project involves loading a car price dataset from a CSV file, data preprocessing, analysis, and the application of linear regression for price prediction. Additionally, data visualization using Seaborn and error calculation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are included.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several main components:
1. **Data Loading:** The initial step is to load the car price dataset from a CSV file into a Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset may contain irrelevant or missing values, which need to be addressed. Data cleaning and modification are performed to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is carried out to understand the characteristics of the dataset. This step involves identifying patterns and trends in the data.

4. **Linear Regression:** Linear regression is applied to build a predictive model for car prices. This model helps in understanding the relationship between different features and the car prices.

5. **Data Visualization:** Seaborn is used to create visualizations that assist in presenting the insights gained from the data analysis and the linear regression model.

6. **Error Calculation:** Various error metrics, including MSE, RMSE, and MAPE, are calculated to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the linear regression model.

**Interpret Results:**
Review the analysis, visualizations, and error metrics provided in the notebook to draw conclusions about car price prediction.
